For now at least, msvc2008 has to be used for binary compatability with all libs. Turns out that Python 2.7 is compiled with msvc2008.


Solution has two projects

- MakerCAD is the main application, linking to
	QT 4.8 - main application framework
	OCE 0.9.1 - geometry engine
	PythonQt (including QtAll) - provide python scripting in qt application

- Install is a utility that
	- Copies MakerCAD/script to Install/Release (or Debug)
	- Copies MakerCAD.exe Release(Debug) to Install/Release(Debug)

Put all needed DLLs either in Install/Release(Debug) or on PATH
to run project. Note that DLLs are different for Release and Debug.

	python27.dll
	OCE 0.9.1 DLLs
	Qt 4.8 DLLs
	PythonQt.dll + PythonQt_QtAll.dll
